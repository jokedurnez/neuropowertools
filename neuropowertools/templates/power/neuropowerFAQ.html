      <h4> What is NeuroPower? </h4>
      <p class="well">NeuroPower is a toolbox that performs sample size calculations for fMRI experiments.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="question">
      <a name="q2"></a>
      <h4> For which kind of data is NeuroPower? </h4>
      <p class="well">The methods are based on a statistical map.  These can be from any source (task-related fMRI, VBM,...) although the methods have been validated for task-related fMRI only. We got a lot of requests for power analyses for connectivity analyses. You can not do this with our toolbox yet, but check back from time to time.  We are working on it! </p>

      <h4>Where can I find pilot data? </h4>
      <div class="well">
      <ul>
        <li><b>Collecting a pilot dataset.</b> Yes, collecting pilot data is expensive.  Yet it is your best option for a good power analysis.  </li>
        <li><b>Open data.</b>  If you don't have the resources to collect pilot data, there's a lot of people sharing their data.  <a href="http://www.neurovault.org">NeuroVault</a> is a good source for statistical maps!.  Try to find an experiment with a comparable study design as yours and you have a good proxy for pilot data.</li>
        <li><b>Previously collected data.</b> You or your colleagues might have data sitting on a computer with an experimental setup comparable to your new study.  You can use these data.  And while you're at it, why not share them online?</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="question">
      <a name="q4"></a>
      <h4>How can I cite NeuroPower? </h4>
      <p class="well">You can find the manuscript on the methodology <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/04/20/049429">bioRchiv</a>.  The paper is currently under review.</p>

      <h4> Who's behind NeuroPower? </h4>
      <p class="well">The main developer is Joke Durnez. Many more people have contributed to the development of the toolbox. In alphabetical order: Jasper Degryse, Beatrijs Moerkerke, Thomas Nichols, JB Poline, Russell Poldrack and Vanessa Sochat.  Many thanks to everyone in the Data Analysis department at Ghent University and the Poldracklab at Stanford for valuable feedback.</p>
